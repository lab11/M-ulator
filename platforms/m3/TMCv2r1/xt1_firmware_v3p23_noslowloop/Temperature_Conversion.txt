< Temperature Conversion >

* All temperature related parameters (such as high threshold, low threshold) must be given as a positive integer, 

    10 * (T + 80)
    
    where T is the actual temperature in celsius degree. 
    
    For example, if user enters 10C for the high threshold, then it must be converted to 10 * (10 + 80) = 900 in the app. 
    And "900" must be written in EEPROM_ADDR_HIGH_TEMP_THRESHOLD. 
    
    Note that it must be a positive integer. Any temperature lower than -80C must be converted to 0.


< Measured temperature >

- 128*N-th sample, where N is a positive integer, is stored without the compression. 
    The sample is converted to "10 * (T + 80)" and then stored. 
    For example, 25C is stored as 1050. 
    The 128*N-th sample always has 11 bits. Thus, 25C (=1050) is stored as 100_0001_1010.

- For other samples, it stores a "compressed" delta, where delta = current sample - previous sample.

- Since we use the "10 * (T + 80)" conversion, the 'delta=1' means 0.1C difference.

- The compression uses the following table.

    -------------------------------------------------

- For example:
    - if delta=+2, it stores 1_1000
    - if delta=+10, it stores {11111, delta} = {11111, 00000001010} = 1111_1000_0000_1010
    - if delta=-10, it stores {10000, absolute value of delta} = {10000, 00000001010} = 1000_0000_0000_1010

- The data is stored starting from Byte#128 in EEPROM. Note the bit index shown below.

        Byte  |                    Bit Index
        Addr  |    MSB                                       LSB
        --------------------------------------------------------
        128   |      7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
        129   |     15    14    13    12    11    10     9     8
        130   |     23    22    21    20    19    18    17    16
        ...

- The data is stored MSB first. See an example below.


< Example >

    Suppose that sample values look like below:
    
        Sample#0 = 250
        Sample#1 = 251
        Sample#2 = 231
    
    Sample#0 is stored without compression. Its bit stream is 000_1111_1010 (11 bits). Its MSB goes into EEPROM's LSB. Thus, the EEPROM would look like below:
    
        Byte  |                    Bit Index
        Addr  |    MSB                                       LSB
        --------------------------------------------------------
        128   |      1     1     1     1     1     0     0     0
        129   |      -     -     -     -     -     0     1     0
    
    The next delta (Sample#1 - Sample#0) is +1. So the compressed data is 011 (3 bits). Its MSB goes into EEPROM's LSB. Thus, the EEPROM would look like below, after storing Sample#1: 
    
        Byte  |                    Bit Index
        Addr  |    MSB                                       LSB
        --------------------------------------------------------
        128   |      1     1     1     1     1     0     0     0
        129   |      -     -     1     1     0     0     1     0
    
    The next delta (Sample#2 - Sample#1) is -20. So the compressed data is {10000, 00000010100} = 1000_0000_0001_0100 (16 bits). Its MSB goes into EEPROM's LSB. Thus, the EEPROM would look like below, after storing Sample#2: 
    
        Byte  |                    Bit Index
        Addr  |    MSB                                       LSB
        --------------------------------------------------------
        128   |      1     1     1     1     1     0     0     0
        129   |      0     1     1     1     0     0     1     0
        130   |      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
        131   |      -     -     0     0     1     0     1     0
    
    It goes on and on. When it reaches Sample#128, it stores the sample uncompressed, as a 11-bit value. From Sample #129, it starts storing the compressed delta again, until it reaches Sample#256, ...


- EEPROM_ADDR_SAMPLE_COUNT tracks the number of samples stored in EEPROM. If it is N, then it means Sample#0 ~ Sample#(N-1) have been stored.
