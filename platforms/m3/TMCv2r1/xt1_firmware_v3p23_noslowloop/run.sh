#-- text: Fixed bits that do not change during execution. This includes compiled code as well as global constants (e.g. "DEADBEEF" would be in the text, as well as all of the body of `main`)
#-- data: Global variables that are not constant *and* are initialized with a value [your example does not have any of these]
#-- bss : Global variables that are not constant *and* are not initialized with a value (e.g. the `enumerated` variable _value_, the address of `enumerated` is in the text section)
